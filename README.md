# LosslessCodingWPF

**LosslessCodingWPF** is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application for visualizing and experimenting with classic lossless data compression algorithms. The project targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 and provides a simple graphical interface for encoding and decoding text using Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Coding, and CABAC (Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding).

## Features

- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):**  
  Encode and decode text using the RLE algorithm, which compresses sequences of repeated characters.

- **Huffman Coding:**  
  Placeholder for Huffman encoding/decoding (algorithm implementation
